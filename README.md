# Polyrhythm

Very early alpha (read, still figuring out who everything works)

Usage so far...

```polyrhythm init```

Answer all the setup prompts and then you'll have a Sinatra instance for your application root
and an authorization service setup (if you chose to install one).

```bundle install```

To install the required gems

```guard```

To start up the server.
